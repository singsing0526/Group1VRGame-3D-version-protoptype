note: terain shader will not works on Lightweight or HD pipelines currentlly (feb 2021)   

You have 3 different terrain shaders:
4-Layers , 6-Layers and 8-Layers

Performance comparison:
4-Layers > 6-Layers > 8-Layers

So the best choice is 4-Layers terrain shader. Only use higher layers shader when you want a very important effects
Because you will lost the performance

Follow Tutorials play list about terrain usage

Quick Start:
- Add at least 4 or 6 or 8 layers into your terrain (paint tan)
- Add LB_Terrain_2 component into your terrain
- Now select layers count and press Initialize button .
- Now you must select terrain material and TextureArrays save path (All splats will be stored into 2 teture arrays, one for Albedo and another for Normal maps)

Note:
- All textures (and normals)must has save texel size (open in Photoshop or GIMP and assign same texture size for all textures)


- All textures must be Read-Write enabled in import settings
